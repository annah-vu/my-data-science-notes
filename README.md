I have learned the process for uploading our work to Github by adding, committing, and pushing it. 
git add File_Name_Here --> git commit --> git push
You can use git commit -m "insert text here" in order to make a quick caption message for your new pushed content. 
You can even use a gitignore function to hide things you don't want other people seeing.
