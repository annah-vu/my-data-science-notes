I have learned the process for uploading our work to Github by adding, committing, and pushing it. 
git add File_Name_Here --> git commit --> git push
You can use git commit -m "insert text here" in order to make a quick caption message for your new pushed content. 
You can even use a gitignore function to hide things you don't want other people seeing. The file name will show up but no one will be able to open it.
You can use git diff to see what changes you have made. 
Use git status to see the status (what will be uploaded)

#The Walkthrough
go to www.github.com/new
Give it a repo name
If you copy the SSH link, go to your terminal and use git clone <insert the link here>

What I actually do tho is create the directories from my terminal upon hearing about the assignement. 
Then I copy the second code given on github when creating a new one that does the whole git init, main branch stuff. 

Run this and Git will be tracking the stuff in that folder (but don't worry, it won't actually upload anything until you tell it to)

now you can touch and code files within this directory

when you're ready to upload things, start with git status and git diff in order to make sure it has the changes you want

git add "file name here" and you don't need the quotation marks 
git commit       and you can leave it blank if it's the same as the one for git add 
git push         and again you can leave it blank

enter your very secret passcode

and check git! presto!
